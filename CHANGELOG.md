## [0.2.0] - 2025-03-01

### Added
- API provider abstraction with `ProvideApi` trait ([#13](https://github.com/commercetools/kuberator/pull/13))
- `StaticApiProvider` for pre-cached API instances
- `CachedApiProvider` for dynamic namespace discovery
- Flexible caching strategies: Strict, Adhoc, and Extendable ([#14](https://github.com/commercetools/kuberator/pull/14))
- Generic `K8sRepository` to eliminate boilerplate
- Comprehensive test suite with Given/When/Then pattern ([#15](https://github.com/commercetools/kuberator/pull/15))

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Upgraded `kube` to v2.0 ([#12](https://github.com/commercetools/kuberator/pull/12))
- **BREAKING**: Upgraded `schemars` to v1.1
- **BREAKING**: `StaticApiProvider::new()` now requires `CachingStrategy` parameter
- Updated all examples and documentation for new API

### Migration Guide (v0.1.x → v0.2.0)

#### Kube v2.0 Upgrade
Update your dependencies:
```toml
kube = { version = "2.0", features = ["runtime", "derive"] }
k8s-openapi = { version = "0.26", features = ["latest"] }
schemars = "1.1"
```

#### StaticApiProvider Changes
Add a caching strategy to all `StaticApiProvider::new()` calls:
```rust
// Before
StaticApiProvider::new(client, vec!["default"])

// After - choose the appropriate strategy
StaticApiProvider::new(client, vec!["default"], CachingStrategy::Strict)
```

**Choosing a strategy:**
- `CachingStrategy::Strict` - Production (lock-free, errors on uncached namespaces)
- `CachingStrategy::Adhoc` - Dynamic environments (lock-free, no caching)
- `CachingStrategy::Extendable` - Runtime discovery (RwLock, lazy loading)

## [0.1.8] - 2025-02-15

### Added
- Graceful shutdown support for controllers ([#10](https://github.com/commercetools/kuberator/pull/10))
- `start()` and `start_concurrent()` now accept optional shutdown signal

## [0.1.7] - 2025-02-01

### Changed
- Various internal improvements and bug fixes
